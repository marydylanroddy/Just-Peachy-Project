           <div class="about_dylan">Like many people, Dylan enjoyed getting her nails done and feeling well put together and confident after a new set! What wedding, birthday or night out was complete without matching polish! <br><br>
            
            However, she had often experienced the crushing disappointment of a chipped nail just days after forking out. It didn't put her off, but it was definitely a point for grumbling. <br><br>

            After the pandemic hit, for months on end, all beauty services were paused, which meant messier and rougher nails. During this time, Dylan decided to buy all of the equipment and supplies and start doing them herself at home. As her skills improved and retrictions eased, she soon began doing the nails of friends and family, who kept remarking this should be something she is charging for. <br><br>

            Once the world got back to some sort of normality, Dylan decided to put her new-found talents to greater use and opened her own salon ay her property. Working from home and around her other commitments means it is easier to get an appointment and all sessions take place in a relaxed, luxurious environment (though we still recommend booking your next one as soon as you've left your current one!). <br><br>

            Dylan also came up with the Nail replacement guarantee - if you get a chip/crack/smudge or some other damage to your nails within the first week, just book back in and she will replace the nail(s) free of charge. She has confidence in her work, but sometimes normal activities, such as doing the dishes or going to the gym, play havoc with our manicures!
