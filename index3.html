        <h3>Gel (Shellac)</h3>
        <p>Gel Shellac nails combine the best features of gel and traditional nail polish. Shellac is a brand name created by CND (Creative Nail Design) and is known for its durability and high-gloss finish.

           <ul><li> Application: Shellac nails are applied like regular nail polish but are cured under a UV lamp, which hardens the polish and makes it long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Durability: They typically last around 10-14 days without chipping. </li>
            <li>Removal: Shellac nails are easier to remove than traditional gel nails, usually requiring a soak in acetone.</li>
            <li>Finish: They offer a shiny, chip-free finish that remains glossy throughout the wear period.</li></ul></p>
      </div>

      <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h3>Acrylic</h3>
        <p>Acrylic nails are created by mixing a liquid monomer and a powder polymer to form a paste, which is then applied to the nail and allowed to harden.
           <ul><li>Appearance: They can be shaped into various styles and are often thicker than gel nails.</li>
            <li>Durability: Known for their strength and durability, making them less likely to break.</li>
           <li>Removal: More challenging to remove and can be damaging to the natural nail if not done properly.</li>
           <li> Maintenance: Requires fills every 2-3 weeks as the natural nail grows out.</li></ul></p>
      </div>
      <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
        <h3>BIAB (Builder in a Bottle)</h3>
        <p>BIAB is a type of nail enhancement that combines the benefits of gel polish and acrylic. It's a popular choice for those looking for a long-lasting, natural-looking manicure that also promotes nail health.
            <ul><li>Application: BIAB is applied like a gel polish but has a thicker consistency, allowing it to create a strong, durable layer over the natural nail.</li>
<li>Durability: It provides a hard-wearing, shiny finish that can last up to 4 weeks without chipping.</li>
<li>Strengthening: BIAB is known for its nail-strengthening properties, making it ideal for those with weak or brittle nails.</li>
<li>Removal: It can be soaked off with acetone, similar to gel polish.</li></ul>

        <h3>Additional services</h3>
        <p><h4> Extensions </h4>
            Nail extensions are artificial enhancements added to the natural nail to increase length and improve appearance. 
            We can apply them using various methods, such as pre-formed tips or sculpting the extension directly on the nail.
            They are designed to be strong and long-lasting, typically requiring maintenance every 2-3 weeks as the natural nail grows.
            Nail extensions can be shaped and styled in various ways, including different lengths, shapes (like stiletto, coffin, or almond), and designs.
            
            <hr>
           <h4> Infills </h4>
            Nail infills are a maintenance procedure for artificial nails (both gel and acrylic).
<ul><li>Purpose: Infills are done to fill in the gap that appears between the cuticle and the artificial nail as the natural nail grows out.</li>
<li>Process: The nail technician will file down the existing product, clean the nail, and apply new acrylic or gel to the regrowth area.</li>
<li>Frequency: Typically, infills are needed every 2-3 weeks, depending on how fast your nails grow.</li>
<li>Benefits: Regular infills help maintain the appearance and strength of the nails, preventing lifting and breakage.</li></ul>

    <h4>Nail art</h4>
    Seen a style you love on Tiktok or Instagram? We will do our best to bring this to life for you, putting our own spin on it, of course! We can offer extras such as glitter, stickers, fine line designs and more. It's best to book these in advance as they will require extra time, but we will provide a quote ahead of starting the set, so you can stick to your budget.
 <hr>
   <h4>Nail removal</h4>
If you are unable to remove your nails at home, we can remove them professionally at the salon. This will need to be booked in addition to your choice of other nails services as we will need extra time. Depending on the length and condition of your nails, this may involve soaking and filing.</p>

  <div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
    <h3>Nail replacement offer</h3>
    <p>We understand how frustrating it can be when you've just had your nails painted, and suddenly there's a chip! For this reason, we offer a replacement when you find damage to your nails within the first week. Use the booking form to find an appointment.</p>
